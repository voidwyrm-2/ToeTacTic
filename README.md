# ToeTacTic
 A tic-tac-toe clone with a pseudo-AI, **Now with multiplayer!**

You and the AI go in turns, simple as that

You're O, the AI is X

Select the space to put a O on with number keys 1-9(the ones at the top of the keyboard)

Next thing I'm doing is adding a app icon and ~~making the AI a bit smarter~~ ok that didn't work, maybe I could just add more variance or something?
<!--(note from the future, after I tried to make the AI smarter: I could not make the AI smarter)-->
